    <p>
        Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.

    <h2 style="color: #503ce5;">HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
    </p>
    
    <!-- Section: HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE? -->
    <h2 style="color: #503ce5;">HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

    <!-- Section: CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES -->
    <h2 style="color: #503ce5;">CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
    <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
    </p>
    <p>
        California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.

    <h2 style="color: #503ce5;">LOCATION SERVICES POLICY</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Addendum to the Privacy Policy for NiteCrawlers App: Location Services and Consents</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Location Services and Consents This addendum to the NiteCrawlers App Privacy Policy clarifies our practices regarding the use of location services, location tracking, geolocation-based advertising, and map tracking. This addendum aims to promote transparency, ensure user consent, and meet the standards set by the Apple App Store, Google Play Store and relevant data protection laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>1. Purpose and Use of Location Services:</strong> NiteCrawlers App utilizes location services to enhance user experience and provide tailored functionality. The primary purposes include:
      <br>• Navigation and Mapping: Real-time location to display user positions on the app’s map and support navigation features.
      <br>• User Experience Optimization: Location-based content, recommendations, and notifications for user convenience.
      <br>• Geolocation-Based Advertising: Delivery of targeted advertising relevant to user locations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2. User Consent for Location Data Collection:</strong> User consent is essential. When first using the app or engaging with location-based features, users are prompted to grant or deny location access. Options include:
      <br>• Allow while using the app.
      <br>• Allow always (background location).
      <br>• Deny location access.
      <br>Additionally, if background location tracking is required, users will receive explicit notification and must provide consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>3. Types of Location Data Collected:</strong> The app may collect:
      <br>• Real-Time Location Data: To show current location on the map, enable navigation, and support live tracking.
      <br>• Historical Location Data: Temporarily stored data (such as trip logs or route history) to enhance service functionality.
      <br>• Approximate Location: Collected when precise data is not necessary, which helps conserve battery life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>4. Geolocation-Based Advertising Practices:</strong> Location data may be used to deliver personalized ads tailored to your area and interests. Users can opt out of geolocation-based advertising via app settings or device-level privacy settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>5. Map Tracking Features:</strong> The app offers map-based tracking features including:
      <br>• Live Location Display: Showing your current location on the in-app map.
      <br>• Location Sharing: Allowing you to share your real-time location with selected contacts or groups (this feature is user-controlled).
      <br>• Route History: Providing trip summaries or journey history, stored securely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>6. Security of Location Data:</strong> Your location data is encrypted during transmission and securely stored. Access to location data is restricted to authorized personnel and only to processes necessary for app functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>7. Retention and Deletion of Location Data:</strong> Location data is retained only as long as necessary to provide services or comply with legal obligations. You have the right to review your stored location data and request its deletion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>8. Third-Party Sharing and Integrations:</strong> The app may share location data with third-party services solely for enhancing functionality (such as integrations with mapping APIs) or for partner services, provided these third parties adhere to strict data privacy standards. No location data is shared for unrelated purposes without your consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>9. User Rights and Controls:</strong> You have the right to adjust location settings, opt out of personalized ads, and request access to, modification of, or deletion of your location data through the app settings or by contacting support.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>10. Compliance and Updates:</strong> NiteCrawlers App complies with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and may update this addendum periodically. Significant changes will be communicated via in-app alerts or email.
